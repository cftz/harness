# Linear Issues Output

Instructions for creating Linear issues from suggestions.

## When to Use

Use this reference when `PROJECT_ID` is provided.

## Process

### 1. Prioritize Suggestions

From the analysis results, identify items that should become issues:
- All Critical and High severity codebase issues
- All High Impact workflow improvements

Group related items to avoid creating too many issues.

### 2. Create Parent Issue (Optional)

If there are multiple suggestions, consider creating a parent issue:

```
skill: linear:linear-issue
args: create TITLE="Improvement Suggestions - {TARGET}" PROJECT={PROJECT_ID} DESCRIPTION="Analysis identified {N} issues."
```

Store the returned issue ID in `parent_issue_id`.

### 3. Create Child Issues

For each prioritized suggestion, create a child issue:

```
skill: linear:linear-issue
args: create TITLE="{Issue title}" PROJECT={PROJECT_ID} PARENT={parent_issue_id} DESCRIPTION="{Detailed description with context and suggested fix}"
```

**Issue Title Format**:
- For codebase issues: `[{Severity}] {Category}: {Brief description}`
- For workflow improvements: `[Improvement] {Area}: {Brief description}`

**Description Template**:
```markdown
## Context

{Description of the issue or improvement opportunity}

## Location

{File path and line number if applicable}

## Suggested Action

{Specific steps to address this}

## Expected Benefit

{What improvement will result}

```

### 4. Create Summary Comment

Create a summary comment on the parent issue:

```
skill: linear:linear-comment
args: create ISSUE_ID={parent_issue_id} BODY="Created {X} child issues from improvement analysis. See children for details."
```

### 5. Return Output

Report the result following the standard output format:

```
STATUS: SUCCESS
OUTPUT:
  RESULT: COMPLETE
  ISSUES_COUNT: Critical={X}, High={Y}, Medium={Z}, Low={W}
  OUTPUT_PATH: Linear Issues created in {PROJECT_ID} (parent: {parent_issue_id})
```

## Notes

- Limit to 10 issues per analysis to avoid overwhelming the backlog
- Combine related small issues into single tickets
- Use labels to categorize (e.g., `tech-debt`, `automation`, `documentation`)
- Consider assigning to appropriate team members if known
